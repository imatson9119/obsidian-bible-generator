# Isaiah 12

###### 1
You will say in that day: “I will give thanks to you, O Lord, for though you were angry with me, your anger turned away, that you might comfort me.
###### 2
“Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for the Lord God is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation.”
###### 3
With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
###### 4
And you will say in that day: “Give thanks to the Lord, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the peoples, proclaim that his name is exalted.
###### 5
“Sing praises to the Lord, for he has done gloriously; let this be made known in all the earth.
###### 6
Shout, and sing for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”
