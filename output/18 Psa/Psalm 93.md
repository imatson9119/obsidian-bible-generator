# Psalm 93

###### 1
The Lord reigns; he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed; he has put on strength as his belt.   Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved.
###### 2
Your throne is established from of old;   you are from everlasting.
###### 3
The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring.
###### 4
Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea,   the Lord  on high is mighty!
###### 5
Your decrees are very trustworthy;   holiness befits your house, O Lord, forevermore.
