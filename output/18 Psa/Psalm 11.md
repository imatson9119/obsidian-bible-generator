# Psalm 11

###### 1
In the Lord I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, “Flee like a bird to your mountain,
###### 2
for behold, the wicked bend the bow; they have fitted their arrow to the string to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart;
###### 3
if the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?”
###### 4
The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord’s throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man.
###### 5
The Lord tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.
###### 6
Let him rain coals on the wicked; fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
###### 7
For the Lord is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.
