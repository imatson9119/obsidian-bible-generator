# Psalm 14

###### 1
The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds; there is none who does good.
###### 2
The Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.
###### 3
They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
###### 4
Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the Lord?
###### 5
There they are in great terror, for God is with the generation of the righteous.
###### 6
You would shame the plans of the poor, but the Lord is his refuge.
###### 7
Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
