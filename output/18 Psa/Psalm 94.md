# Psalm 94

###### 1
O Lord, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth!
###### 2
Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve!
###### 3
O Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?
###### 4
They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
###### 5
They crush your people, O Lord, and afflict your heritage.
###### 6
They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless;
###### 7
and they say, “The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive.”
###### 8
Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise?
###### 9
He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?
###### 10
He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge—
###### 11
the Lord—knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.
###### 12
Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O Lord, and whom you teach out of your law,
###### 13
to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
###### 14
For the Lord will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage;
###### 15
for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
###### 16
Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers?
###### 17
If the Lord had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.
###### 18
When I thought, “My foot slips,” your steadfast love, O Lord, held me up.
###### 19
When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.
###### 20
Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by statute?
###### 21
They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
###### 22
But the Lord has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.
###### 23
He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the Lord our God will wipe them out.
