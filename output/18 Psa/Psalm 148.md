# Psalm 148

###### 1
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights!
###### 2
Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his hosts!
###### 3
Praise him, sun and moon, praise him, all you shining stars!
###### 4
Praise him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens!
###### 5
Let them praise the name of the Lord! For he commanded and they were created.
###### 6
And he established them forever and ever; he gave a decree, and it shall not pass away.
###### 7
Praise the Lord from the earth, you great sea creatures and all deeps,
###### 8
fire and hail, snow and mist, stormy wind fulfilling his word!
###### 9
Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars!
###### 10
Beasts and all livestock, creeping things and flying birds!
###### 11
Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth!
###### 12
Young men and maidens together, old men and children!
###### 13
Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above earth and heaven.
###### 14
He has raised up a horn for his people, praise for all his saints, for the people of Israel who are near to him. Praise the Lord!
