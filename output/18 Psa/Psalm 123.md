# Psalm 123

###### 1
To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in the heavens!
###### 2
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God, till he has mercy upon us.
###### 3
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us, for we have had more than enough of contempt.
###### 4
Our soul has had more than enough of the scorn of those who are at ease, of the contempt of the proud.
