# Psalm 34

###### 1
I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
###### 2
My soul makes its boast in the Lord; let the humble hear and be glad.
###### 3
Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together!
###### 4
I sought the Lord, and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears.
###### 5
Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed.
###### 6
This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.
###### 7
The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them.
###### 8
Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!
###### 9
Oh, fear the Lord, you his saints, for those who fear him have no lack!
###### 10
The young lions suffer want and hunger; but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
###### 11
Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
###### 12
What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good?
###### 13
Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.
###### 14
Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
###### 15
The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry.
###### 16
The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
###### 17
When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles.
###### 18
The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.
###### 19
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.
###### 20
He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken.
###### 21
Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
###### 22
The Lord redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
