# Psalm 118

###### 1
Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!
###### 2
Let Israel say, “His steadfast love endures forever.”
###### 3
Let the house of Aaron say, “His steadfast love endures forever.”
###### 4
Let those who fear the Lord say, “His steadfast love endures forever.”
###### 5
Out of my distress I called on the Lord; the Lord answered me and set me free.
###### 6
The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me?
###### 7
The Lord is on my side as my helper; I shall look in triumph on those who hate me.
###### 8
It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man.
###### 9
It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes.
###### 10
All nations surrounded me; in the name of the Lord I cut them off!
###### 11
They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side; in the name of the Lord I cut them off!
###### 12
They surrounded me like bees; they went out like a fire among thorns; in the name of the Lord I cut them off!
###### 13
I was pushed hard, so that I was falling, but the Lord helped me.
###### 14
The Lord is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.
###### 15
Glad songs of salvation are in the tents of the righteous: “The right hand of the Lord does valiantly,
###### 16
the right hand of the Lord exalts, the right hand of the Lord does valiantly!”
###### 17
I shall not die, but I shall live, and recount the deeds of the Lord.
###### 18
The Lord has disciplined me severely, but he has not given me over to death.
###### 19
Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the Lord.
###### 20
This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter through it.
###### 21
I thank you that you have answered me and have become my salvation.
###### 22
The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
###### 23
This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.
###### 24
This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
###### 25
Save us, we pray, O Lord! O Lord, we pray, give us success!
###### 26
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! We bless you from the house of the Lord.
###### 27
The Lord is God, and he has made his light to shine upon us. Bind the festal sacrifice with cords, up to the horns of the altar!
###### 28
You are my God, and I will give thanks to you; you are my God; I will extol you.
###### 29
Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!
