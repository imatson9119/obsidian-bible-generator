# Psalm 122

###### 1
I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the Lord!”
###### 2
Our feet have been standing within your gates, O Jerusalem!
###### 3
Jerusalem—built as a city that is bound firmly together,
###### 4
to which the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord.
###### 5
There thrones for judgment were set, the thrones of the house of David.
###### 6
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! “May they be secure who love you!
###### 7
Peace be within your walls and security within your towers!”
###### 8
For my brothers and companions’ sake I will say, “Peace be within you!”
###### 9
For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your good.
