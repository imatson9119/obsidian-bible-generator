# Psalm 135

###### 1
Praise the Lord! Praise the name of the Lord, give praise, O servants of the Lord,
###### 2
who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God!
###### 3
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing to his name, for it is pleasant!
###### 4
For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel as his own possession.
###### 5
For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
###### 6
Whatever the Lord pleases, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.
###### 7
He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth, who makes lightnings for the rain and brings forth the wind from his storehouses.
###### 8
He it was who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and of beast;
###### 9
who in your midst, O Egypt, sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants;
###### 10
who struck down many nations and killed mighty kings,
###### 11
Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,
###### 12
and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to his people Israel.
###### 13
Your name, O Lord, endures forever, your renown, O Lord, throughout all ages.
###### 14
For the Lord will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.
###### 15
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands.
###### 16
They have mouths, but do not speak; they have eyes, but do not see;
###### 17
they have ears, but do not hear, nor is there any breath in their mouths.
###### 18
Those who make them become like them, so do all who trust in them.
###### 19
O house of Israel, bless the Lord! O house of Aaron, bless the Lord!
###### 20
O house of Levi, bless the Lord! You who fear the Lord, bless the Lord!
###### 21
Blessed be the Lord from Zion, he who dwells in Jerusalem! Praise the Lord!
