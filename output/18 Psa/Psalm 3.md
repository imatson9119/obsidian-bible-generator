# Psalm 3

###### 1
O Lord, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me;
###### 2
many are saying of my soul,   “There is no salvation for him in God.” Selah
###### 3
But you, O Lord, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.
###### 4
I cried aloud to the Lord, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah
###### 5
I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the Lord sustained me.
###### 6
I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.
###### 7
Arise, O Lord! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked.
###### 8
Salvation belongs to the Lord; your blessing be on your people! Selah
