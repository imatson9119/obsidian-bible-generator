# Psalm 4

###### 1
Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!
###### 2
O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies? Selah
###### 3
But know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him.
###### 4
Be angry, and do not sin;   ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Selah
###### 5
Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the Lord.
###### 6
There are many who say, “Who will show us some good?   Lift up the light of your face upon us, O Lord!”
###### 7
You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound.
###### 8
In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.
