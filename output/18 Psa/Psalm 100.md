# Psalm 100

###### 1
Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!
###### 2
Serve the Lord with gladness!   Come into his presence with singing!
###### 3
Know that the Lord, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
###### 4
Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise! Give thanks to him; bless his name!
###### 5
For the Lord is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations.
