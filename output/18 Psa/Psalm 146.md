# Psalm 146

###### 1
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord, O my soul!
###### 2
I will praise the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.
###### 3
Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation.
###### 4
When his breath departs, he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish.
###### 5
Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God,
###### 6
who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who keeps faith forever;
###### 7
who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets the prisoners free;
###### 8
the Lord opens the eyes of the blind. The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down; the Lord loves the righteous.
###### 9
The Lord watches over the sojourners; he upholds the widow and the fatherless, but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin.
###### 10
The Lord will reign forever, your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the Lord!
