# Psalm 127

###### 1
Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
###### 2
It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives to his beloved sleep.
###### 3
Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb a reward.
###### 4
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of oneâ€™s youth.
###### 5
Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.
