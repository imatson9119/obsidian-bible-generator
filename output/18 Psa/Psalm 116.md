# Psalm 116

###### 1
I love the Lord, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy.
###### 2
Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.
###### 3
The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish.
###### 4
Then I called on the name of the Lord: “O Lord, I pray, deliver my soul!”
###### 5
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; our God is merciful.
###### 6
The Lord preserves the simple; when I was brought low, he saved me.
###### 7
Return, O my soul, to your rest; for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.
###### 8
For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling;
###### 9
I will walk before the Lord   in the land of the living.
###### 10
I believed, even when I spoke: “I am greatly afflicted”;
###### 11
I said in my alarm,   “All mankind are liars.”
###### 12
What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me?
###### 13
I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord,
###### 14
I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people.
###### 15
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
###### 16
O Lord, I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds.
###### 17
I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the Lord.
###### 18
I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people,
###### 19
in the courts of the house of the Lord, in your midst, O Jerusalem.   Praise the Lord!
