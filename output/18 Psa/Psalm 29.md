# Psalm 29

###### 1
Ascribe to the Lord, O heavenly beings,   ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
###### 2
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness.
###### 3
The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the Lord, over many waters.
###### 4
The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.
###### 5
The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
###### 6
He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox.
###### 7
The voice of the Lord flashes forth flames of fire.
###### 8
The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
###### 9
The voice of the Lord makes the deer give birth and strips the forests bare, and in his temple all cry, “Glory!”
###### 10
The Lord sits enthroned over the flood; the Lord sits enthroned as king forever.
###### 11
May the Lord give strength to his people! May the Lord bless his people with peace!
