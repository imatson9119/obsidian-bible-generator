# Psalm 84

###### 1
How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord of hosts!
###### 2
My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts of the Lord; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God.
###### 3
Even the sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
###### 4
Blessed are those who dwell in your house, ever singing your praise! Selah
###### 5
Blessed are those whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.
###### 6
As they go through the Valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; the early rain also covers it with pools.
###### 7
They go from strength to strength; each one appears before God in Zion.
###### 8
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah
###### 9
Behold our shield, O God; look on the face of your anointed!
###### 10
For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
###### 11
For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly.
###### 12
O Lord of hosts, blessed is the one who trusts in you!
