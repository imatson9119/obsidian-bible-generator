# Psalm 125

###### 1
Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
###### 2
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people, from this time forth and forevermore.
###### 3
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land allotted to the righteous, lest the righteous stretch out their hands to do wrong.
###### 4
Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in their hearts!
###### 5
But those who turn aside to their crooked ways the Lord will lead away with evildoers!   Peace be upon Israel!
