# Psalm 96

###### 1
Oh sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth!
###### 2
Sing to the Lord, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day.
###### 3
Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples!
###### 4
For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods.
###### 5
For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
###### 6
Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
###### 7
Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength!
###### 8
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts!
###### 9
Worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness; tremble before him, all the earth!
###### 10
Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns! Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity.”
###### 11
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
###### 12
let the field exult, and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy
###### 13
before the Lord, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.
