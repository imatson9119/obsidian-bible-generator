# Psalm 115

###### 1
Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!
###### 2
Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
###### 3
Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases.
###### 4
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands.
###### 5
They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see.
###### 6
They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell.
###### 7
They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat.
###### 8
Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them.
###### 9
O Israel, trust in the Lord! He is their help and their shield.
###### 10
O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord! He is their help and their shield.
###### 11
You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord! He is their help and their shield.
###### 12
The Lord has remembered us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron;
###### 13
he will bless those who fear the Lord, both the small and the great.
###### 14
May the Lord give you increase, you and your children!
###### 15
May you be blessed by the Lord, who made heaven and earth!
###### 16
The heavens are the Lord’s heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of man.
###### 17
The dead do not praise the Lord, nor do any who go down into silence.
###### 18
But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the Lord!
