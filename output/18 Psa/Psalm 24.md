# Psalm 24

###### 1
The earth is the Lordâ€™s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein,
###### 2
for he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers.
###### 3
Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in his holy place?
###### 4
He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false and does not swear deceitfully.
###### 5
He will receive blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
###### 6
Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah
###### 7
Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.
###### 8
Who is this King of glory? The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, mighty in battle!
###### 9
Lift up your heads, O gates! And lift them up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.
###### 10
Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah
