# Psalm 6

###### 1
O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath.
###### 2
Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am languishing; heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.
###### 3
My soul also is greatly troubled. But you, O Lordâ€”how long?
###### 4
Turn, O Lord, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love.
###### 5
For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise?
###### 6
I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.
###### 7
My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my foes.
###### 8
Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.
###### 9
The Lord has heard my plea; the Lord accepts my prayer.
###### 10
All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.
