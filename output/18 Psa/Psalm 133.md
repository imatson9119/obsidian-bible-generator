# Psalm 133

###### 1
Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!
###### 2
It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes!
###### 3
It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! For there the Lord  has commanded the blessing, life forevermore.
