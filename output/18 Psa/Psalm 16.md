# Psalm 16

###### 1
Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
###### 2
I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord;   I have no good apart from you.”
###### 3
As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.
###### 4
The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on my lips.
###### 5
The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.
###### 6
The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
###### 7
I bless the Lord who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.
###### 8
I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.
###### 9
Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure.
###### 10
For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol,   or let your holy one see corruption.
###### 11
You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
