# Psalm 98

###### 1
Oh sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
###### 2
The Lord has made known his salvation; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
###### 3
He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
###### 4
Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth; break forth into joyous song and sing praises!
###### 5
Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre, with the lyre and the sound of melody!
###### 6
With trumpets and the sound of the horn make a joyful noise before the King, the Lord!
###### 7
Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; the world and those who dwell in it!
###### 8
Let the rivers clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together
###### 9
before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
