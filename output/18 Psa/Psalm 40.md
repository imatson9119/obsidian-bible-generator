# Psalm 40

###### 1
I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry.
###### 2
He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
###### 3
He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord.
###### 4
Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after a lie!
###### 5
You have multiplied, O Lord my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; none can compare with you! I will proclaim and tell of them, yet they are more than can be told.
###### 6
In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.
###### 7
Then I said, “Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me:
###### 8
I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.”
###### 9
I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; behold, I have not restrained my lips, as you know, O Lord.
###### 10
I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation.
###### 11
As for you, O Lord, you will not restrain your mercy from me; your steadfast love and your faithfulness will ever preserve me!
###### 12
For evils have encompassed me beyond number; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me.
###### 13
Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me! O Lord, make haste to help me!
###### 14
Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether who seek to snatch away my life; let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt!
###### 15
Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, “Aha, Aha!”
###### 16
But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation say continually, “Great is the Lord!”
###### 17
As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God!
