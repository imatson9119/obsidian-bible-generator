# Psalm 12

###### 1
Save, O Lord, for the godly one is gone; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man.
###### 2
Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
###### 3
May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,
###### 4
those who say, “With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?”
###### 5
“Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise,” says the Lord; “I will place him in the safety for which he longs.”
###### 6
The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.
###### 7
You, O Lord, will keep them; you will guard us from this generation forever.
###### 8
On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the children of man.
