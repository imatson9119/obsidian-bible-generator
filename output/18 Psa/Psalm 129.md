# Psalm 129

###### 1
“Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth”— let Israel now say—
###### 2
“Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me.
###### 3
The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows.”
###### 4
The Lord is righteous; he has cut the cords of the wicked.
###### 5
May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned backward!
###### 6
Let them be like the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up,
###### 7
with which the reaper does not fill his hand nor the binder of sheaves his arms,
###### 8
nor do those who pass by say, “The blessing of the Lord be upon you! We bless you in the name of the Lord!”
