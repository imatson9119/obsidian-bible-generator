# Psalm 92

###### 1
It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
###### 2
to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night,
###### 3
to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre.
###### 4
For you, O Lord, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy.
###### 5
How great are your works, O Lord! Your thoughts are very deep!
###### 6
The stupid man cannot know; the fool cannot understand this:
###### 7
that though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever;
###### 8
but you, O Lord, are on high forever.
###### 9
For behold, your enemies, O Lord, for behold, your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.
###### 10
But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil.
###### 11
My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.
###### 12
The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
###### 13
They are planted in the house of the Lord; they flourish in the courts of our God.
###### 14
They still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green,
###### 15
to declare that the Lord is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
