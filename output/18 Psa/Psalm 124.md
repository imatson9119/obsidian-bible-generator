# Psalm 124

###### 1
If it had not been the Lord who was on our side— let Israel now say—
###### 2
if it had not been the Lord who was on our side when people rose up against us,
###### 3
then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us;
###### 4
then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us;
###### 5
then over us would have gone the raging waters.
###### 6
Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us as prey to their teeth!
###### 7
We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped!
###### 8
Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
