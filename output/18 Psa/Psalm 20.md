# Psalm 20

###### 1
May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob protect you!
###### 2
May he send you help from the sanctuary and give you support from Zion!
###### 3
May he remember all your offerings and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices! Selah
###### 4
May he grant you your heartâ€™s desire and fulfill all your plans!
###### 5
May we shout for joy over your salvation, and in the name of our God set up our banners! May the Lord fulfill all your petitions!
###### 6
Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving might of his right hand.
###### 7
Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
###### 8
They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright.
###### 9
O Lord, save the king! May he answer us when we call.
