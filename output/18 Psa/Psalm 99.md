# Psalm 99

###### 1
The Lord reigns; let the peoples tremble! He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake!
###### 2
The Lord is great in Zion; he is exalted over all the peoples.
###### 3
Let them praise your great and awesome name!   Holy is he!
###### 4
The King in his might loves justice. You have established equity; you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
###### 5
Exalt the Lord our God;   worship at his footstool!   Holy is he!
###### 6
Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel also was among those who called upon his name. They called to the Lord, and he answered them.
###### 7
In the pillar of the cloud he spoke to them; they kept his testimonies and the statute that he gave them.
###### 8
O Lord our God, you answered them; you were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrongdoings.
###### 9
Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy!
