# Psalm 126

###### 1
When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream.
###### 2
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy; then they said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.”
###### 3
The Lord has done great things for us; we are glad.
###### 4
Restore our fortunes, O Lord, like streams in the Negeb!
###### 5
Those who sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy!
###### 6
He who goes out weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with shouts of joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
