# Psalm 87

###### 1
On the holy mount stands the city he founded;
###### 2
the Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.
###### 3
Glorious things of you are spoken, O city of God. Selah
###### 4
Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Cush— “This one was born there,” they say.
###### 5
And of Zion it shall be said, “This one and that one were born in her”; for the Most High himself will establish her.
###### 6
The Lord records as he registers the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah
###### 7
Singers and dancers alike say, “All my springs are in you.”
