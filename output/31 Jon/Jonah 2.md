# Jonah 2

###### 1
Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish,
###### 2
saying, “I called out to the Lord, out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice.
###### 3
For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me.
###### 4
Then I said, ‘I am driven away from your sight; yet I shall again look upon your holy temple.’
###### 5
The waters closed in over me to take my life; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped about my head
###### 6
at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever; yet you brought up my life from the pit, O Lord my God.
###### 7
When my life was fainting away, I remembered the Lord, and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple.
###### 8
Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love.
###### 9
But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Salvation belongs to the Lord!”
###### 10
And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land.
