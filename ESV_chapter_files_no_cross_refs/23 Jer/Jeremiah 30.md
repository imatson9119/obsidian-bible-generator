# Jeremiah 30

###### 1
The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
###### 2
“Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.
###### 3
For behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah, says the Lord, and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall take possession of it.”
###### 4
These are the words that the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah:
###### 5
“Thus says the Lord: We have heard a cry of panic, of terror, and no peace.
###### 6
Ask now, and see, can a man bear a child?   Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor?   Why has every face turned pale?
###### 7
Alas! That day is so great   there is none like it; it is a time of distress for Jacob; yet he shall be saved out of it.
###### 8
“And it shall come to pass in that day, declares the Lord of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and I will burst your bonds, and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him.
###### 9
But they shall serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
###### 10
“Then fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the Lord, nor be dismayed, O Israel; for behold, I will save you from far away,   and your offspring from the land of their captivity.   Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, and none shall make him afraid.
###### 11
For I am with you to save you, declares the Lord;   I will make a full end of all the nations among whom I scattered you, but of you I will not make a full end.   I will discipline you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
###### 12
“For thus says the Lord:   Your hurt is incurable,   and your wound is grievous.
###### 13
There is none to uphold your cause, no medicine for your wound,   no healing for you.
###### 14
All your lovers have forgotten you; they care nothing for you; for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy, the punishment of a merciless foe, because your guilt is great,   because your sins are flagrant.
###### 15
Why do you cry out over your hurt?   Your pain is incurable. Because your guilt is great,   because your sins are flagrant, I have done these things to you.
###### 16
Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured, and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity;   those who plunder you shall be plundered,   and all who prey on you I will make a prey.
###### 17
For I will restore health to you, and your wounds I will heal, declares the Lord, because they have called you an outcast:   ‘It is Zion, for whom no one cares!’
###### 18
“Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his dwellings; the city shall be rebuilt on its mound, and the palace shall stand where it used to be.
###### 19
Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving, and the voices of those who celebrate.   I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will make them honored, and they shall not be small.
###### 20
Their children shall be as they were of old, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all who oppress them.
###### 21
Their prince shall be one of themselves;   their ruler shall come out from their midst;   I will make him draw near, and he shall approach me,   for who would dare of himself to approach me? declares the Lord.
###### 22
And you shall be my people, and I will be your God.”
###### 23
Behold the storm of the Lord! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
###### 24
The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intentions of his mind.   In the latter days you will understand this.
