# Psalm 70

###### 1
Make haste, O God, to deliver me! O Lord, make haste to help me!
###### 2
Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life! Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt!
###### 3
Let them turn back because of their shame who say, “Aha, Aha!”
###### 4
May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you! May those who love your salvation say evermore, “God is great!”
###### 5
But I am poor and needy;   hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay!
