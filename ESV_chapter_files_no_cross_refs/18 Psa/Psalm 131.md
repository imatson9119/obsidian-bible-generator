# Psalm 131

###### 1
O Lord, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.
###### 2
But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me.
###### 3
O Israel, hope in the Lord from this time forth and forevermore.
