# Psalm 97

###### 1
The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad!
###### 2
Clouds and thick darkness are all around him;   righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
###### 3
Fire goes before him and burns up his adversaries all around.
###### 4
His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles.
###### 5
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth.
###### 6
The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory.
###### 7
All worshipers of images are put to shame, who make their boast in worthless idols;   worship him, all you gods!
###### 8
Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of your judgments, O Lord.
###### 9
For you, O Lord, are most high over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.
###### 10
O you who love the Lord, hate evil! He preserves the lives of his saints; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
###### 11
Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.
###### 12
Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name!
