# Psalm 103

###### 1
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name!
###### 2
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,
###### 3
who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases,
###### 4
who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,
###### 5
who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
###### 6
The Lord works righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed.
###### 7
He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel.
###### 8
The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
###### 9
He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever.
###### 10
He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.
###### 11
For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;
###### 12
as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
###### 13
As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him.
###### 14
For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.
###### 15
As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field;
###### 16
for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.
###### 17
But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children’s children,
###### 18
to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.
###### 19
The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
###### 20
Bless the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, obeying the voice of his word!
###### 21
Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers, who do his will!
###### 22
Bless the Lord, all his works, in all places of his dominion.   Bless the Lord, O my soul!
