# Psalm 7

###### 1
O Lord my God, in you do I take refuge;   save me from all my pursuers and deliver me,
###### 2
lest like a lion they tear my soul apart, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver.
###### 3
O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,
###### 4
if I have repaid my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause,
###### 5
let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it, and let him trample my life to the ground and lay my glory in the dust. Selah
###### 6
Arise, O Lord, in your anger;   lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies;   awake for me; you have appointed a judgment.
###### 7
Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you; over it return on high.
###### 8
The Lord  judges the peoples;   judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me.
###### 9
Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and may you establish the righteousâ€” you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God!
###### 10
My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
###### 11
God is a righteous judge, and a God who feels indignation every day.
###### 12
If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow;
###### 13
he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts.
###### 14
Behold, the wicked man conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies.
###### 15
He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made.
###### 16
His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own skull his violence descends.
###### 17
I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord, the Most High.
