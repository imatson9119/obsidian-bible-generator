# Psalm 27

###### 1
The Lord is my light and my salvation;   whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
###### 2
When evildoers assail me to eat up my flesh, my adversaries and foes, it is they who stumble and fall.
###### 3
Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, yet I will be confident.
###### 4
One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple.
###### 5
For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock.
###### 6
And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy;   I will sing and make melody to the Lord.
###### 7
Hear, O Lord, when I cry aloud; be gracious to me and answer me!
###### 8
You have said, “Seek my face.” My heart says to you, “Your face, Lord, do I seek.”
###### 9
Hide not your face from me. Turn not your servant away in anger, O you who have been my help. Cast me not off; forsake me not,   O God of my salvation!
###### 10
For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord will take me in.
###### 11
Teach me your way, O Lord, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.
###### 12
Give me not up to the will of my adversaries; for false witnesses have risen against me, and they breathe out violence.
###### 13
I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living!
###### 14
Wait for the Lord;   be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the Lord!
