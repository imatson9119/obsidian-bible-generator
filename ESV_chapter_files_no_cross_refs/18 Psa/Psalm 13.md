# Psalm 13

###### 1
How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
###### 2
How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
###### 3
Consider and answer me, O Lord my God;   light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
###### 4
lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed over him,” lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.
###### 5
But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
###### 6
I will sing to the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me.
