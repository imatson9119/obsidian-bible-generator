# Psalm 114

###### 1
When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
###### 2
Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
###### 3
The sea looked and fled;   Jordan turned back.
###### 4
The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
###### 5
What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?
###### 6
O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs?
###### 7
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
###### 8
who turns the rock into a pool of water,   the flint into a spring of water.
