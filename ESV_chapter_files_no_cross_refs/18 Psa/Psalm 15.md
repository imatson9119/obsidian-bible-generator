# Psalm 15

###### 1
O Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill?
###### 2
He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart;
###### 3
who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend;
###### 4
in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the Lord; who swears to his own hurt and does not change;
###### 5
who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.
